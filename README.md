# Comparative PS Analytics

Historians, political scientists, and political economists often employ comparative analysis as a way to draw insights, formulate and test theories, and discover intriguing patterns or anomalies. Intended for students and academics in such disciplines, Comparative PS Analytics offers a data visualization approach to studying regime change and development. Users can select two countries and see a graph of polity (measure of democratic vs authoritarian) scores over time as well as a scatterplot of GDP per capita over time with corresponding polity scores. Users can also interact with the graphs to view search results for that country for a particular year, allowing them to learn more about a country's history.
