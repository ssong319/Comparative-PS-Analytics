<h2> About these metrics </h2>

<h4 class="headlines"> Polity </h4>
<p class="detail">The polity score ranges from -10(full autocracy) to +10(full democracy). The dataset covers all major states from 1800-2014 with a total population of 500,000 or more. The data is obtained from Center for Systemic Peace's Polity IV Project. More information about this metric can be found on Center for Systemic Peace's <a href="http://www.systemicpeace.org/polityproject.html">website</a>. </p>

<h4 class="headlines"> GDP per Capita </h4>
<p class="detail"> Data taken using the World Bank API. From World Bank: "GDP per capita is gross domestic product divided by midyear population. GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in current U.S. dollars." See <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD">source</a>.</p>

<h4 class="headlines"> Ease of Doing Business </h4>
<p class="detail">From World Bank: Ease of doing business ranks economies from 1 to 189, with first place being the best. A high ranking (a low numerical rank) means that the regulatory environment is conducive to business operation. The index averages the country's percentile rankings on 10 topics covered in the World Bank's Doing Business. The ranking on each topic is the simple average of the percentile rankings on its component indicators. See World Bank's <a href="http://www.doingbusiness.org/">Doing Business Project</a> for more information. </p>

<h4 class="headlines"> Political Stability </h4>
<p class="detail"> From Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI): Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism measures perceptions of the likelihood of political instability and/or politically-motivated violence, including terrorism. Estimate of governance ranges from approximately -2.5 (weak) to 2.5 (strong). This metric is one of six indicators used in WGI's governance dataset.
